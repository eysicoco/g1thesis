		 <img src="../PICS/unit 1 pics/sbt1.jpg" alt="Image Description">
		 <p>The early period of the Philippines from 22,000 BCE to 1521 AD can be further broken 
		 down into detailed sections that explore a variety of different aspects, including prehistoric 
		 migrations, the development of societies, the trade networks, religious and cultural influences, and the arrival of the Spanish.</p>

</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h1 id="sbt1"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>22,000 BCE – Pre- Historic Philippines</h1>
<h3>Early Human Settlements (22,000 BCE - 5,000 BCE)</h3><br><p>
The earliest known human remains in the Philippines, dating back to roughly 22,000 BCE, indicate a long history of human habitation in the archipelago. These remains, known as the "Tabon Man," were discovered in the Tabon Caves in Palawan in 1962. Though initially thought to be a single individual, additional discoveries revealed that the remains represented numerous individuals, providing insight into early human existence in the region.<br><br>

Tabon Man is one of Southeast Asia's oldest human fossils, and it is thought that these early people were part of the first wave of human migrations into the region. These migrations were probably linked to larger movements out of Africa and across mainland Asia. The tools and artifacts discovered alongside the Tabon Man bones indicate that the early settlers were hunter-gatherers who relied on stone tools to survive.<br><br>

As the millennia passed, these early people transitioned from hunter-gatherers to more settled agricultural societies. Climate change and the development of new technologies, such as plant and animal domestication, are thought to have affected this transition. It is thought that early Filipinos farmed rice, root crops, and other foods. Archaeological evidence suggests that these people lived in caves or built temporary shelters as they traveled around looking for food.

</p><br><br>
<h3>Stone Tools and Early Cultures</h3><br><p>
Stone tools discovered in sites such as Palawan suggest early human activity in the Philippines. The finding of "Callao Man" in the Cagayan Valley, which dates back around 67,000 years, precedes the Tabon Man and demonstrates much older human presence in the region. Callao Man, likely a member of the species Homo luzonensis, 
shows that early human migration and settlement in the Philippines occurred far earlier than previously thought, adding to our understanding of ancient human history in Southeast Asia.

</p><br><br><h1 id="sbt2"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>5,000 BCE - 1,000 BCE</h1>
<h3>Austronesian Migration (circa 3,000 BCE)</h3><br><p>
Austronesian-speaking peoples came from Taiwan to the Philippines between 3,000 and 2,000 BCE, bringing extensive knowledge of agriculture, boatbuilding, and pottery. They introduced rice cultivation, domesticated animals, and the use of metal tools, resulting in the development of established populations and increasingly complex societies. Their contributions, which included maritime abilities and the use of metal, influenced early Filipino culture and facilitated the formation of trade networks and established governmental systems.<br><br>

<h3>Development of Early Societies</h3><br><p>
Early Filipino towns developed near riverbanks, coastal locations, and fertile plains, thriving on agriculture, fishing, and maritime trade. These settlements evolved into small, independent communities known as barangays, which were led by datus. The reliance on fishing and trade with nearby regions aided the growth of these barangays, resulting in interconnected but self-sufficient societies. This paved the way for increasingly complex social and political systems in the Philippines.

</p><br><br><h1 id="sbt3"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>1,000 BCE - 1000 AD</h1>
<h3>Iron Age (500 BCE - 1000 AD)</h3><br><p>
By the Iron Age in the Philippines, metalworking using bronze and iron had spread, resulting in advanced tools, weapons, and artifacts that benefited agriculture, defense, and trade. This period also saw the formation of social strata, with datus (chieftains) controlling communities and being supported by nobles and soldiers. A distinction between commoners and dependent classes, such as slaves or alipin, arose, resulting in a highly stratified society. These developments paved the way for more organized chiefdoms and complicated political structures in the future.<br><br>

<h3>Trade with Neighboring Regions (200 BCE - 900 AD)</h3><br><p>
During this time, marine commerce networks expanded, connecting the Philippines to China, India, and the Malay Archipelago. This enormous trade facilitated substantial cultural interactions, influencing Philippine languages, customs, and religious activities.<br><br>
The Chinese and Indian textiles became extremely popular on the islands, reflecting the increased desire for luxury items. By the ninth century, foreign traders were making regular visits to the Philippines, allowing for not just economic exchanges but also the sharing of ideas, technology, and ideologies. These exchanges enhanced local cultures, adding to the diversity of Philippine society while also laying the framework for increasingly complex social systems and cultural identities. The infusion of new goods and influences shaped the islands into a thriving center of trade and cultural interchange in Southeast Asia.

<h3>Laguna Copperplate Inscription (900 AD)</h3><br><p>	 
The oldest known written document in the Philippines is an inscription in Kawi script that records a debt repayment. This record suggests that a highly literate culture with established and intricate political processes existed at the time.<br><br>
Furthermore, the impact of Indianized cultures, as well as Hindu and Buddhist traditions, grew widespread in certain regions of the Philippines, notably in the south, such as Mindanao. These influences were brought by traders and migrants, resulting in the introduction of new ideas, art forms, and religious beliefs that enhanced the cultural landscape. This combination of local and foreign components helped the Philippines build a distinct identity, reflecting the archipelago's role as a hub of trade and cultural interchange in Southeast Asia.<br><br>	

<h3>Emergence of Kingdoms and Sultanates (1000 AD - 1521 AD)</h3><br><p>
During this time, various tiny kingdoms and sultanates arose in the Philippines, each adding to the political scene. Notable among them were the Rajahnate of Butuan in Mindanao, the Rajahnate of Cebu, and the Kingdom of Tondo on Luzon. These governments played important roles in local governance, trade, and cultural interaction.<br><br>
The Sultanates of Sulu and Maguindanao were created in the southern Philippines during the 13th and 14th centuries, bringing Islam to the region. Muslim missionaries and traders helped spread Islamic doctrines and practices, which had a significant impact on local culture, governance, and social institutions.<br><br>

<h3>Trade Networks and Contact with China and Southeast Asia:</h3><br><p>
During the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, the Philippines traded with China actively, trading luxury commodities like porcelain and silk for gold, pearls, and local products. Trade with Brunei, Indonesia, and Malaysia also thrived, helping to develop the region's maritime cultures. These trading networks helped shape the Philippines' economy and culture.<br><br>
	
<h3>Religious and Cultural Influences</h3><br><p>
By the 14th century, Islam had expanded to the southern Philippines through trade and missionary operations, particularly among the Tausug, Maranao, and Maguindanaon peoples. This resulted in the foundation of Islamic sultanates and a long-term cultural and theological impact in the region.<br><br>
At the same time, early Philippine kingdoms were heavily influenced by Hindu and Buddhist culture, as seen by art, architecture, and local folklore. These influences were spread through regional trade networks, combining with local beliefs and influencing early Filipino culture.<br><br>
	
<h3>The Arrival of the Spanish (1521 AD)</h3><br><p>	
The first European to make meaningful contact with the Philippines occurred in 1521, when Portuguese adventurer Ferdinand Magellan was traveling to Spain. His presence signaled the start of Spanish interest in colonizing the islands, which began officially in 1565 under Miguel López de Legazpi.<br><br>	
Magellan's presence provoked confrontation with native chieftains, particularly Lapu-Lapu, the ruler of Mactan, who resisted Spanish attempts to establish dominance. Lapu-Lapu's soldiers killed Magellan at the Battle of Mactan, marking the beginning of Filipino resistance to European colonization.<br><br>
