<h1 id="sbt1"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>Early Spanish Expeditions</h1><p>	 
	Ferdinand Magellan arrived in the Philippines in 1521 during a Spanish expedition he led as a Portuguese explorer. His landing on the island of Cebu marked the first significant European contact with the islands, which he claimed for Spain, naming them the Islas de San Lazaro. Magellan established friendly ties with some local chiefs and converted a few to Roman Catholicism. However, he was later killed by a group of natives led by Chief Lapu-Lapu, who resisted foreign domination.
	<br><br>

	In the following decades, other Spanish expeditions were sent to the islands. In 1543, Ruy López de Villalobos led one such expedition, naming the islands of Samar and Leyte Las Islas Filipinasin honor of Spain’s Prince Philip (later King Philip II). This name was eventually applied to the entire Philippine archipelago.
	<br><br>


</p><br><br><h1 id="sbt2"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>Spanish Colonization</h1><p>
	The Spanish conquest of the Philippines did not fully begin until 1564, when an expedition from New Spain, led by Miguel López de Legazpi, arrived. Permanent Spanish settlement was established in 1565 when Legazpi, the first Governor-General of the Philippines, arrived in Cebu. Spanish authority was soon imposed over many small, independent communities that had previously lacked any central government. Six years later, after defeating a local Muslim ruler, Legazpi founded the capital in Manila, attracted by its excellent harbor in Manila Bay, large population, and proximity to the fertile rice lands of central Luzon. Manila quickly became the hub of Spanish civil, military, religious, and commercial activities in the Philippines. By 1571, Legazpi had established the Spanish city of Manila on the site of a former Moro town he had conquered a year earlier, solidifying Spain's control over the islands. Despite resistance from the Portuguese, who sought to maintain their monopoly over East Asian trade, the Philippines became a strategic outpost in the East Indies under Spanish rule. The islands were governed as a province of New Spain (Mexico) until Mexico gained independence in 1821.
	<br><br>
	In 1574, Manila repelled an attack by the Chinese pirate Limahong. Although the Chinese had traded with the Filipinos for centuries before the arrival of the Spanish, it wasn't until after the conquest that they began settling in the islands. Chinese labor and trade were crucial to the early development of the Spanish colony, but the growing Chinese population led to fear and resentment among the Spanish. In 1603, the Spanish massacred thousands of Chinese settlers, and there were smaller-scale massacres in subsequent years.
	<br><br>
	In 1589, the Spanish governor was elevated to the status of a viceroy, ruling with the advice of the powerful royal audiencia. Frequent uprisings occurred as Filipinos resisted the encomienda system, a system of forced labor and tribute. By the end of the 16th century, Manila had become a major commercial hub in East Asia, engaging in prosperous trade with China, India, and the East Indies. While the Philippines did provide some wealth, including gold, for Spain, its galleons, which transported valuable cargo between the islands and New Spain, were often targeted by English pirates.
	<br><br>
	The period from 1600 to 1663 saw continued warfare with the Dutch, who were establishing their empire in the East Indies, as well as with Moro pirates. One of Spain's greatest challenges was dealing with the Moros (Muslims) of Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago, who carried out raids on Luzon and the Visayas in retaliation for Spanish and allied native attacks. The Spanish launched sporadic campaigns against the Muslims, but they only achieved significant success in the mid-19th century.
	<br><br>
	Spanish occupation of the Philippines was relatively bloodless, in part because most of the population, except for the Muslims, did not initially offer much armed resistance. The invasion of Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago by the Muslims, however, presented a persistent problem, as they frequently raided Spanish-controlled areas. The Spanish waged irregular military campaigns against the Muslims, achieving no decisive results until much later in the colonial period.
	<br><br>
	In Spain's colonial policy, church and state were tightly intertwined, with the state taking responsibility for religious institutions. One of Spain's primary goals in colonizing the Philippines was to convert the local population to Catholicism. The absence of other organized religions, aside from Islam in the south, facilitated this process. The grandeur of the Catholic Church's rituals and its incorporation of local customs made it widely appealing. As a result, a Christian majority emerged among the lowland Malay population, while the Muslims in the south and the tribal peoples in the mountains remained largely detached.
	<br><br>
	At the local level, the Spanish adapted traditional village governance by co-opting local leaders, creating a principalía, or Filipino upper class, which held local power, wealth, and privileges. This system of indirect rule allowed the Spanish to maintain control through a local oligarchy. One of the major changes under Spanish rule was the introduction of private land ownership, replacing the Filipino practice of communal land use. Land titles were granted to members of the principalía, further entrenching their status.
	<br><br>
	Despite its strategic location, the Philippines was not a highly profitable colony for Spain. A long war with the Dutch in the 17th century, combined with ongoing conflicts with the Muslims, strained the colonial treasury. Most of the colony's income came from entrepôt trade. The Manila Galleons brought silver from Acapulco (Mexico), which was traded for Chinese goods, but there was no direct trade with Spain itself.
	<br><br>


</p><br><br><h1 id="sbt3"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>Decline of Spanish Rule</h1><p>
	Spanish rule in the Philippines was briefly interrupted in 1762 when British forces invaded and occupied the islands during Spain’s involvement in the Seven Years’ War. However, the Treaty of Paris in 1763 restored Spanish control, and the British withdrew by 1764. Although brief, the British occupation weakened Spain’s hold on the Philippines, sparking rebellions and growing demands for independence.
	<br><br>
	In 1781, Governor-General José Basco y Vargas established the Economic Society of Friends of the Country to promote economic development. By this time, the Philippines was directly governed by Spain. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 significantly reduced travel time to Spain, bringing new ideas to the Philippines and allowing many young Filipinos, known as ilustrados, to study in Europe. These ilustrados became an enlightened upper class and were key to the rise of Filipino nationalism.
	<br><br>
	Inspired by the Propaganda Movement, the ilustrados initially sought representation in the Spanish Cortes but later advocated for independence. The most notable of these intellectuals was José Riza, whose novels, Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo, exposed the abuses of the Spanish colonial government and clergy, fueling the independence movement. Around this time, Andrés Bonifacio founded the Katipunan, a secret society dedicated to overthrow Spanish rule.
	<br><br>
	The Philippine Revolution began in 1896. Although Rizal did not support the armed uprising, he was implicated and executed for treason that same year. The Katipunan then split into two factions: the Magdiwang, led by Bonifacio, and the Magdalo, led by Emilio Aguinaldo. The rivalry between Bonifacio and Aguinaldo ended with Bonifacio's execution by Aguinaldo’s forces. Aguinaldo later negotiated the Pact of Biak-na-Bato, which resulted in his exile to Hong Kong along with other revolutionaries.
	<br><br>
	Opposition to the Spanish clergy's power was a major factor in the growing demand for independence. Widespread Spanish injustices, prejudice, and economic oppression also contributed to the movement, which was further inspired by Rizal’s writings. After his execution in December 1896, the revolution spread across the Philippines. Under Aguinaldo’s leadership, Filipino forces achieved several victories, but a temporary peace with Spain was short-lived. Hostilities resumed with the outbreak of the Spanish-American War in 1898.
	<br><br>
	The Spanish-American War began after the USS Maine was sunk in Havana Harbor amid efforts to mediate between Cuban independence and Spanish colonial rule. On May 1, 1898, Commodore George Dewey led the U.S. Navy to a decisive victory over the Spanish fleet at Manila Bay. The U.S. invited Emilio Aguinaldo to return to the Philippines, hoping he would unite the Filipinos against Spanish colonial forces. By the time U.S. ground troops arrived, Filipino forces had already taken control of most of Luzon, except for the walled city of Intramuros in Manila, which they were besieging.
	<br><br>
	On June 12, 1898, Aguinaldo declared the Philippines' independence in Kawit, Cavite, and established the First Philippine Republic under Asia’s first democratic constitution. However, hopes for independence were dashed when, under the Treaty of Paris (1898), Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States, along with Guam and Puerto Rico, in exchange for $20 million. This treaty officially ended the Spanish-American War.
	<br><br>
	Meanwhile, a German squadron under Admiral Diedrichs arrived in Manila, asserting that if the U.S. did not claim the Philippines, Germany would. Filipino representative Felipe Agoncillo was ignored in the Treaty of Paris negotiations, and some believe the Battle of Manila between Spain and the U.S. was an effort to exclude Filipinos from the occupation of the city. Despite opposition in the U.S., the decision was made not to return the Philippines to Spain or allow German control. The first Philippine Republic, led by Aguinaldo, resisted the American occupation, leading to the Philippine-American War(1899–1913).
