		 <img src="../PICS/unit 1 pics/sbt1.jpg" alt="Image Description">
		 
<br><h1 id="sbt1"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>Prelude to war</h1><p>
In the mid-19th century, as the United States sought to expand its territory, Spain’s control over its colonies weakened, particularly in the Philippines. The signing of the Pact of Biak na Bato sparked reform efforts among Filipinos. A new Governor General, unfamiliar with the local situation, took charge as tensions rose due to the Cuban rebellion against Spain. The U.S., with interests in Cuba, allied with the rebels and prepared to confront Spain.
<br><br>
An intercepted letter from the Spanish ambassador, calling President McKinley weak, fueled American outrage. Additionally, allegations of mistreatment of Americans in Cuba contributed to negative sentiments toward Spain. The explosion of the U.S. warship Maine in Havana Harbor, which killed 246 people, served as the catalyst for the Spanish-American War, further straining relations between the two nations.
<br><br>

On April 25, 1898, General George Dewey received a telegram announcing the start of war between Spain and the United States. He then sailed from Mears Bay, near Hong Kong, to Manila Bay, arriving on May 1, where he found Spanish forces at Sangley Point, Cavite.
<br><br>

</p><br><br><h1 id="sbt2"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>Battle of Manila Bay</h1><p>
Dewey directed his forces toward Sangley Point and, upon confirming they were ready to attack, instructed the captain of the flagship Olympia to open fire:
<br><br>

“Start firing if you’re ready!”
<br><br>

The battle was nearly one-sided, as Spanish forces were unprepared for American weaponry. This victory ignited enthusiasm among Americans, many of whom were unfamiliar with the Philippines' location. After defeating the Spanish fleet in the Battle of Manila Bay, Dewey blockaded Intramuros to prevent any Spanish ships from escaping or entering.
<br><br>


</p><br><br><h1 id="sbt3"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>Aguinaldo’s Return</h1><p>
During his exile in Hong Kong, Emilio Aguinaldo and his government became aware of the conflict between Spain and the United States. They viewed this situation as a crucial opportunity to remove Spanish control from the Philippines. However, tensions within Aguinaldo's government arose regarding the distribution of funds received from the Spanish government after the signing of a pact. This disagreement led Isabelo Artacho to file a lawsuit against Aguinaldo, who evaded the court hearing by fleeing to Singapore with his associates, Gregorio del Pilar and Jay Leyva.
<br><br>

While in Singapore, American Consul E. Spencer Pratt advised Aguinaldo to place his trust in the United States and join them in the fight against Spain. Aguinaldo expressed his desire to return to the Philippines to continue the revolution.
<br><br>

Pratt communicated with Admiral George Dewey, who agreed to facilitate Aguinaldo’s return to Hong Kong. However, by the time Aguinaldo arrived, Dewey had already departed. Aguinaldo met with the American Consul in Hong Kong, Roon Zeville Wildman, who informed him that Dewey had issued orders for Aguinaldo to return to the Philippines. Wildman also advised Aguinaldo to establish a military government upon his arrival, which would reflect the structure of the U.S. government following the war. Aguinaldo then instructed Wildman to purchase weapons for the revolutionary forces. While he was able to acquire an initial batch of weapons, the subsequent order was not fulfilled, and Wildman failed to return the funds to Aguinaldo.
<br><br>

Before returning to the Philippines, the Hong Kong Junta, which was Aguinaldo's government, decided to rejoin the struggle for independence. Aguinaldo successfully arrived in Cavite in May 1898. After his arrival, he conferred with General Dewey aboard the USS Olympia, where Dewey reassured him that the United States had no plans to establish a colonial regime in the Philippines, which he believed. 
<br><br>

Aguinaldo's return sparked a resurgence of enthusiasm among Filipinos, leading many to volunteer for the revolution. During this time, various provinces were captured by Filipino rebels, significantly diminishing Spanish control in the region. Almost all of Luzon was under Filipino command, with the exceptions of Cavite and the Port of Manila.
<br><br>

On June 12, 1898, Emilio Aguinaldo proclaimed the independence of the Philippines at his residence in Cavite El Viejo. During this event, the "Acta de la Proclamación de Independencia del Pueblo Filipino," penned by Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista, was signed by 98 Filipino nationals. The sole surviving copy of this document, referred to as "The Birth Certificate of the Filipino Nation," was handwritten by Lieutenant Colonel Jose Bañuelo. Following this proclamation, Aguinaldo issued a decree on June 18 to formally establish his dictatorial government. Subsequently, on June 23, he replaced the dictatorial regime with a revolutionary government, designating himself as president. On July 15, Aguinaldo further solidified his authority by issuing three organic decrees that assumed civil governance over the Philippines.
<br><br>

However, the situation for the Filipinos took an unexpected turn. The Americans did not plan to attack Intramuros due to a lack of troops. In response, Aguinaldo's forces surrounded Intramuros, cutting off food and water supplies. This resulted in severe suffering for the residents, who faced hunger and thirst. Aguinaldo urged Governor-General Agustin to surrender, but Agustin refused, citing his commitment to their Code of Honor.
<br><br>

	 
</p><br><br><h1 id="sbt4"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>Mock Battle</h1><p>	 
When American reinforcements arrived, preparations for an assault on Manila began. Meanwhile, Admiral Dewey sought to persuade General Agustin to surrender through the Belgian Consul. Although Agustin was considering surrender, he was replaced by General Haudene, who negotiated a mock battle with Dewey and General Merritt to save face.
<br><br>

Dewey agreed, but Haudene insisted that Filipino rebels should not participate, which Dewey accepted, believing the Filipinos were allies. At that time, the Filipinos had nearly complete control over Manila and were monitoring the Spanish in Intramuros.
<br><br>

Filipinos were ordered to vacate the Bayside in Intramuros for the Americans to take over. Aguinaldo requested that General Merritt provide a written order, which Merritt agreed to after leaving Bayside, and the Filipinos complied.
<br><br>

The steady arrival of American troops surprised Aguinaldo's government, which began to question America's true intentions. Meanwhile, the Americans prepared for the mock battle, and General Anderson sent a warning to Aguinaldo not to position troops along the Pasig River due to impending gunfire.
<br><br>

On August 13, despite warnings, the mock battle occurred after negotiations with Haudene. Aguinaldo positioned Filipino forces on General MacArthur's left flank. The mock battle lasted several hours, and around 11:30, the Spaniards raised a white flag, signaling their surrender.
<br><br>
	
</p><br><br><h1 id="sbt4"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>America’s True Intention </h1><p>
The Filipinos had initially seen the Americans as aiding them in their independence from Spain, but the Americans did not see things this way. For  them, it was an opportunity, as President William McKinley put it : 
<br><br>

“to uplift and civilize and Christianize them” 
<br><br>

Americans established a military government at Manila In August 1898. With this self-created authority, they set up local governments, including schools and courts, with the American model. 
<br><br>

On August 12, 1898, the United States and Spain entered into a peace protocol in Washington, D.C. Although the complete text of the protocol was not disclosed to the public until November 5, Article III explicitly stated that "The United States will occupy and hold the City, Bay, and Harbor of Manila, pending the conclusion of a treaty of peace that shall determine the control, disposition, and government of the Philippines." General Merritt was informed of this protocol on August 16, shortly after the surrender of Manila. A subsequent telegram, dated August 17, communicated to Admiral Dewey and General Merritt that the United States was to maintain full control over Manila, prohibiting any joint occupation. Following additional negotiations, insurgent forces withdrew from the city on September 15, thereby marking the end of Filipino-American collaboration.
<br><br>

<strong>"We must conquer the Philippines if we are to have peace."</strong> General Thomas M. Anderson, American military leader
<br><br>

President McKinley subsequently issued a directive demanding the full cession of the Philippine archipelago. This led to the signing of the Treaty of Paris in December 1898, which officially ended the Spanish-American War. A key provision of the treaty was the transfer of the archipelago to the United States in exchange for $20 million in compensation. In 1900, the Treaty of Washington further clarified this agreement, stating that any Spanish territories in the archipelago not specifically included in the geographical boundaries outlined in the Treaty of Paris were also ceded to the United States.
<br><br>

After the Treaty of Paris was signed, President McKinley issued the Benevolent Assimilation proclamation on December 21, outlining America’s true intentions in the Philippines, stating that the US would control the Philippine government. General Otis, upon reading it, saw that it might have a negative impact on Filipinos. The US aimed to win the hearts of the Filipinos, so they needed to feel they were not being colonized.
<br><br>

Thus, when the Benevolent Assimilation was published, Otis modified parts to suggest that America was there to help the Filipinos. However, General Miller in Iloilo published the original version, leading to outrage among revolutionaries who realized America’s true intentions. Luna criticized this in the newspaper La Independencia.
<br><br>

In response, Aguinaldo issued a counter-proclamation against this. His intentions were clear, but to Otis, this counter-proclamation indicated that Aguinaldo was seeking war. Aguinaldo's government tried to ease tensions between the two sides.
<br><br>

They held a conference with the Americans, who convinced them that they would listen to Filipino grievances. However, it was just a tactic to delay fighting, as they awaited reinforcements. Growing tensions between America and the Philippines erupted on February 4, 1899, when American and Filipino soldiers faced each other at San Juan Bridge. The encounter happened by chance, as Filipino troops stationed near the Americans came into contact with them. According to Private William Grayson, when he spotted armed Filipino soldiers, he shouted, "Halt," but they kept moving forward. He called out again, and the Filipino soldier replied with "Halto." Grayson then fired his weapon, hitting the Filipino soldier, who fell to the ground.
<br><br>

</p><br><br><h1 id="sbt4"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>War of America and Filipino</h1><p>
The news of the confrontation reached General MacArthur, who promptly declared the beginning of war between American and Filipino forces. In an attempt to clarify the situation, Aguinaldo sent a letter to General Ores, insisting that the chaos was not instigated by him. However, Otis suggested that, since hostilities had already commenced, they should continue their efforts.
<br><br>

As Aguinaldo sought to investigate the incident, American troops launched attacks on various locations in Manila, capturing Pasig and other cities. After taking La Loma, the Americans set their sights on Kalookan, where General Luna was stationed. Although the Americans secured victory there, Luna devised a plan to retake Manila but was ultimately defeated.
<br><br>

Luna retreated to Pulo, where he established his headquarters. When American reinforcements arrived, they captured Pulo and advanced to Malolos, where Aguinaldo's government was located. Faced with growing danger, Aguinaldo fled to San Isidro, Nueva Ecija.
<br><br>

After a brief stay in Malolos, MacArthur pursued them to Kalumpit. The defense was expected to be strong, as the Americans needed to cross the Bagbag River. However, this defense failed because the hot-headed Luna had gone to Pampanga to confront General Mascardo, leaving only General Gregorio del Pilar to defend the position. Their defeat marked the beginning of the rapid fall of provinces and cities to American control.
<br><br>

Amid this turmoil, tensions within Aguinaldo's cabinet led to Luna's assassination, a significant loss for the Filipino resistance. Luna’s plans were not followed through. In other parts of the Philippines, it was increasingly challenging for Filipino troops to maintain their struggle against the Americans. Aguinaldo hoped to continue the resistance, but fighting was becoming impossible as American control expanded.
<br><br>

With new American strategies, Aguinaldo was forced to retreat further into the mountains, where access to resources became a significant challenge. His troops struggled with a lack of food, leading to the deterioration of their strength. Aguinaldo's strategy was to strengthen his defenses, making it difficult for the Americans to advance. In many skirmishes, the Americans suffered losses due to their tendency to be in the open, while Aguinaldo and his men effectively used the terrain to their advantage.
<br><br>

The Filipinos were poorly equipped for conventional warfare against a modern state, often relying on bows, arrows, and spears instead of firearms. After several months of direct conflict, they adopted guerrilla tactics to inflict consistent losses on American forces rather than attempting a complete military takeover. In response, the United States adjusted its strategies, establishing concentration camps to segregate civilians for their supposed protection from guerrilla activities.
<br><br>

Prisoners of war camps suffered from inadequate supplies, leading to rampant diseases that caused more Filipino deaths than the fighting itself. The insurgency continued, prompting General Arthur MacArthur to declare martial law on December 20, 1900. Meanwhile, an American Commission led by future President William Howard Taft began developing a new government structure, aiming to persuade some resistance leaders to abandon their anti-American efforts.
<br><br>

Hostilities waned significantly after President Aguinaldo's capture in March 1901.
<br><br>

He officially surrendered on April 19 and called on his people to lay down their arms, though some local leaders, like Miguel Malvar and Vicente Lukban, continued to resist until April 1902, with isolated pockets of resistance lingering until 1913.
<br><br>
 
The war ultimately resulted in greater costs in lives and resources for the U.S. than the Spanish-American War, with at least 200,000 Filipino civilians perishing due to disease and famine. The U.S. employed a scorched-earth policy in guerrilla-infested areas and resorted to extreme measures for information extraction, while Filipino fighters also used brutal tactics against captured Americans.
<br><br>

The casualties during the Philippine-American War were disproportionately higher among Filipinos compared to Americans. Nearly 4,000 American soldiers died out of approximately 125,000 who served in the conflict. In contrast, around 20,000 Filipino combatants lost their lives, along with an estimated 250,000 to 1 million non-combatants. The non-combatant deaths were attributed to several factors, including a severe cholera epidemic and violence perpetrated by U.S. military forces. This violence included targeted attacks on civilians and the establishment of concentration camps, which significantly contributed to the high death toll.
<br><br>

</p><br><br><h1 id="sbt4"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>Insular Government</h1><p>
After the war, the Philippines were placed under the Insular Government, a territorial administration accountable to the United States, aimed at guiding the country toward independence. In 1907, elections were held for an assembly that served as the lower house of a bicameral legislature, with the U.S.-appointed Philippine Commission as the upper house. This assembly regularly passed resolutions calling for independence.
<br><br>

The Philippine Autonomy Act, or Jones Law, enacted in 1916, replaced the Commission with an elected Senate and asserted U.S. support for Philippine independence, although no specific timeline was provided. Efforts toward independence stalled during World War I, but after the war, a Philippine delegation sought support in Washington. President Woodrow Wilson indicated that the Philippines were ready for independence in 1921, though his successors disagreed.
<br><br>

In January 1933, the U.S. established a timeline for independence through the Philippine Independence Act of 1934, which outlined the process for drafting a constitution and forming a commonwealth. The new constitution took effect on November 15, 1935, setting July 4, 1946, as the date for the Philippines to gain independence from U.S. oversight.
<br><br>

</p><br><br><h1 id="sbt4"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>Philippine Commonwealth</h1><p>
The period from 1935 to 1946 was intended for the Philippines to transition to full independence, allowing for significant autonomy. However, the outbreak of war with Japan disrupted these plans.
<br><br>

On May 14, 1935, Manuel L. Quezon of the Nacionalista Party was elected the first president of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, establishing a government inspired by the U.S. Constitution. The new commonwealth featured a strong executive, a unicameral assembly, and a Supreme Court composed entirely of Filipinos for the first time since 1901.
<br><br>

Quezon prioritized defense, social justice, economic diversification, and the promotion of national identity. Tagalog was declared the national language, women gained the right to vote, and land reform was proposed. The government aimed to strengthen national defense, gain economic control, reform education, improve transportation, colonize Mindanao, and encourage local industry. However, it faced agrarian unrest, an unstable diplomatic situation, and doubts about U.S. commitment to Philippine independence. Amid landless peasant protests, public lands were opened for resettlement.
<br><br>

In 1939–1940, the Constitution was amended to restore a bicameral Congress and allow Quezon to seek re-election. From 1940 to 1941, with U.S. support, several mayors in Pampanga advocating for land reform were removed from office. After the 1946 election, some legislators opposing special economic treatment from the U.S. were barred from taking their positions.
