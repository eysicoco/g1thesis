		 <h2 id="sbt1"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>Japanese Occupation Period, 1942-1945</h2><p>
		 <img src="../PICS/unit 1 pics/sbt1.jpg" alt="Image Description">
		 
The period of Japanese occupation in the Philippines, from 1942 to 1945, marked a dark and tragic era in the nation’s history. Throughout this time, Filipinos faced great suffering and hardship, yet they showed extraordinary bravery and determination in their resistance against the invaders.
<br><br>

Japan sought access to Southeast Asia's natural resources—oil, rubber, and minerals—to support its growing economy and military. Japan wanted to remove U.S. influence in Southeast Asia to access natural resources and make it easier to defend its territories. They planned to destroy the American Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, thinking the U.S. would not react. Recognizing the Philippines' importance, the U.S. grew worried as Japan's power increased, leading to the National Defense Act, which combined U.S. and Filipino forces into the United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFE). Despite diplomatic efforts to prevent conflict in the late 1930s, these attempts failed.
<br><br>

In December 1941, Japan launched a surprise attack on the US naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. The U.S. was furious and declared war on Japan. Four hours after the Japanese weakened American forces in the Pacific by bombing Pearl Harbor, Japan bombed various locations in the Philippines.
<br><br>

On December 8, 1941, Clark Field was attacked, along with Davao, Baguio, Apari, Nichols Field, and Sangley Point. By the end of December, the Japanese targeted Manila, which General MacArthur declared an open city to reduce destruction, but bombings continued.
<br><br>

Japanese forces landed at Bataan and quickly advanced to Apari, Pandan, and Legaspi. With few military defenses, resistance was minimal. Rumors of U.S. warplanes arriving were false; Japan had already destroyed American aircraft at Clark and Nichols. By December 22, the Japanese had landed in Lingayen, and by January 2, 1942, they had captured Manila.
<br><br>

On December 24, MacArthur told President Quezon to evacuate to Corregidor. Quezon held a final cabinet meeting, confirming that several officials, including Justice Secretary Jose Abad Santos and Vice President Sergio Osmeña, would accompany him. Chief Justice Jose Laurel also wanted to join.
<br><br>

But Quezon insisted, <strong>“Not you, Laurel; someone must face the Japanese. The people need protection. Tough times are ahead.” </strong>
<br><br>

Laurel understood the challenges ahead and asked, <strong>“How can I negotiate with them?”</strong> MacArthur replied, <strong>“You can do anything, just don’t swear allegiance to the Japanese flag. If anyone does, I will shoot them myself upon my return.”</strong> Laurel then took his oath as the new Secretary of Justice.
<br><br>

Quezon's last instructions to the Commonwealth officials were clear:
<br><br>

<strong>“Do everything. Plead with them if you can. Do all you can to keep the Philippines united. Protect the Filipinos from Japanese brutality. You will face tough decisions, but do everything for the future of the Philippines.”</strong>
<br><br>

On December 30, Quezon took his oath for a second term as President in Corregidor. His escape with American forces succeeded, and the Japanese struggled to capture the USAFFE due to Corregidor's defenses.
<br><br>


</p><br><br><h1 id="sbt2"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>Bataan Death March</h1><p>
As time passed, U.S. assistance arrived for the soldiers, impacted by the Europe First Policy. The weakening of USAFFE intensified with MacArthur’s departure to Australia on March 11, 1942 with his famous line
<br><br>

“I shall return”
<br><br>

He made this promise to the Filipino people, vowing to return and liberate the islands. 
<br><br>

Quezon left on February 18 aboard the submarine Swordfish. General Jonathan Wainwright took over from MacArthur, but on April 9, General Edward P. King decided to surrender his troops in Bataan.
<br><br>

Most of the 80,000 prisoners of war taken by the Japanese at Bataan were compelled to participate in the "Bataan Death March" to Camp O'Donnell in Capas, Tarlac, located 105 kilometers north of Mariveles. Thousands of soldiers, already weakened by illness and malnutrition, suffered brutal treatment from their captors and died before reaching the camp. Upon reaching Capas, they were imprisoned like animals, starved, and fell ill. In fact, more men perished from Japanese mistreatment in the first four months in the camps than during the four months of combat prior.
<br><br>


</p><br><br><h1 id="sbt3"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>Occupation</h1><p>
Despite their promise of independence for the islands, the Japanese military authorities immediately began organizing a new government structure, with the Council of State in charge of civil affairs until October 1943, when they declared the Philippines an independent republic. However, the Japanese were not content with just political control. They also implemented a brutal system of sexual slavery, taking more than 1,000 Filipinos, including mothers, girls, and gay men, as comfort women for their military personnel.
<br><br>

These victims, some as young as 10 years old, were imprisoned and subjected to unthinkable horrors. The Japanese military installations in the Philippines each had a comfort station, where women were held as sex slaves. Bahay Napula was just one of the many locations where women were forcibly taken and subjected to gang rape, torture, and humiliation.
<br><br>

Many suffered injuries, had their breasts cut off, or were killed if they resisted the soldier's sexual advances. The victims were treated like animals, with many being murdered and disposed of without dignity. In addition to the sexual enslavement of women and girls, Japanese doctors and surgeons conducted grotesque human experiments on their victims.
<br><br>

These experiments included amputations, dissections, and suturing blood vessels of live humans, with some victims being forced to dig their own graves before the procedure. Vivisections, the dissection of the stomach, were performed on live Filipinos, with some left with gaping stomachs and intestines spilled out before being dumped in their graves to die. The perpetrators of these heinous acts, many of whom remained at large in Japan until their comfortable retirement, attempted to cover up their crimes for decades.
<br><br>

Those who spoke out faced harassment from Japanese ultra-nationalists intent on protecting their country's image. Despite this, the Japanese occupation of the Philippines sparked fierce resistance from guerrilla fighters and underground groups. These brave individuals risked their lives to combat oppression, and by the end of the war, Japan controlled only 12 out of 48 provinces.
<br><br>

	 
</p><br><br><h1 id="sbt4"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>End of Occupation</h1><p>	 
When General MacArthur returned to the Philippines in late 1944, he arrived well-informed, having gathered extensive intelligence, but faced a formidable Japanese defense determined to halt the American advance. The Japanese military poured every available resource into protecting the islands, including creating the kamikaze corps. The Battle of Leyte Gulf marked the largest naval clash of World War II and ended in disaster for Japan. 
<br><br>

MacArthur's Allied forces landed on Leyte on October 20, 1944, with Sergio Osmeña, who succeeded Quezon as president. Subsequent landings occurred at Mindoro and Lingayen Gulf as they pushed toward Manila. Fierce fighting erupted, especially in northern Luzon and Manila, where Japanese forces made their last stand. Filipino guerrillas played a critical role, supplementing American units and aiding in logistics and civil administration.
<br><br>

The guerrilla fighters were well-organized, communicating with each other and relaying information to the US Army. Recognizing their crucial role, General MacArthur initiated covert operations to support them, with Lieutenant Commander Charles Chick Parsons smuggling weapons and supplies. Guerrilla forces accumulated arms and planned sabotage against Japanese communications.
<br><br>

By war's end, 277 guerrilla units, comprising over 260,000 fighters, had bravely opposed Japanese forces. As Allied forces advanced, fighting intensified, especially in northern Luzon's mountains, culminating in Japan's surrender on September 2, 1945. The conflict resulted in an estimated 527,000 Filipino deaths, with 141,000 massacred, 22,500 dying from forced labor, and 336,500 succumbing to war-related famine.
<br><br>

Following the war, select resistance units were integrated into the Philippine Army, bringing valuable combat experience that would shape the military's future. The legacy of these resistance fighters serves as a testament to the resilience and strength of the Filipino people. The war left a devastating toll, with significant casualties for both U.S. and Japanese forces, but the suffering of the Filipino population was especially tragic, marked by famine and disease in the years that followed.
