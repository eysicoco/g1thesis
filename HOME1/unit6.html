<h1 id="sbt1"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>Independence (1946)</h1><p>		
The Philippines joined the United Nations as a founding member on October 11, 1945. Consequently, the Treaty of Manila, which was signed on July 4, 1946, during Manuel Roxas's administration, allowed the United States to formally recognize the Philippines as an independent country. With this pact, American rule over the islands was terminated and the independence of the Republic of the Philippines was recognized. Independence Day was observed on July 4 from 1946 until 1961. On the other hand, June 12, 1962 was designated as a special public holiday by President Macapagal on May 12, 1962. Independence Day was formally rescheduled to June 12 by Republic Act No. 4166 in 1964, which also declared July 4 to be Philippine Republic Day.
<br><br>

The post-war history of the Philippines reflects a delicate balance between the successful attainment of independence and ongoing internal struggles. Following liberation from Japanese occupation by the United States in the summer of 1945, the Republic of the Philippines was established on July 4, 1946. The early decades of this new nation were characterized by a blend of economic and social reforms, as well as an effort to place the Philippines on the global stage.
<br><br>

The challenges faced by the nascent republic began even before independence. President Manuel Quezon passed away in 1944 while leading his government in exile in the United States, and his Vice President, Sergio Azmeña, succeeded him. Azmeña was relatively unknown to the public, and his political party had lost popularity during the Japanese occupation. The first presidential elections for the new republic took place in April 1946, prior to formal independence, to avoid a lame duck period in case of a change in leadership. Azmeña's rival was Manuel Roxas, a populist candidate backed by General Douglas MacArthur. 
<br><br>


</p><br><br><h1 id="sbt2"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>The Roxas Administration (1946–1948)</h1><p>
When the Congress of the Philippines was convened in 1945, the legislators elected in 1941 chose Manuel Roxas as Senate President. In the national elections of 1946, Roxas ran for president as the nominee of the liberal wing of the Nacionalista Party, bolstered by the strong support of General MacArthur. His opponent, Sergio Osmeña, chose not to campaign, believing that his reputation was well-known among the Filipino people. On April 23, 1946, Roxas won 54 percent of the vote, leading the Liberal Party to a majority in the legislature. When the Philippines gained independence from the United States on July 4, 1946, Roxas became the first president of the new republic.
<br><br>

Roxas aimed to rebuild the nation not only after the difficult years of Japanese occupation but also to address nearly four centuries of foreign domination endured by the Filipino people. He sought to bring the Philippines into the United Nations and open the archipelago to the world. However, the rebuilding of his country depended heavily on substantial loans from the United States. To secure these funds, his administration signed 99-year lease agreements with the U.S. for major military bases, tying the Philippine and American economies closely together.
<br><br>

While Roxas successfully obtained rehabilitation funds, he was forced to concede military bases, impose trade restrictions on Filipino citizens, and grant special privileges to U.S. property owners and investors. His presidency was marred by allegations of graft and corruption, and the abuses of provincial military police contributed to the rise of the left-wing Hukbalahap (Huk) movement in the countryside. His heavy-handed attempts to suppress the Huks led to widespread discontent among peasants.
<br><br>

During his term, the administration of the Turtle Islands and Mangsee Islands was transferred from the United Kingdom to the Philippines, in accordance with treaties established between the U.S. and the U.K. in 1930. Although these islands were recognized as part of the Philippine archipelago, they were initially administered by the British North Borneo Company until a formal transfer occurred on October 16, 1947.
<br><br>

Tragically, Roxas's presidency was cut short when he suffered a fatal heart attack while speaking at Clark Air Base on April 15, 1948. He was succeeded by his vice president, Elpidio Quirino.
<br><br>


</p><br><br><h1 id="sbt3"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>The Quirino Administration (1948–1953)</h1><p>
Quirino assumed the presidency on April 17, 1948, just two days after Manuel Roxas's death. His administration began amidst accusations of corruption, particularly during the 1949 election against former wartime president Jose P. Laurel, who was widely believed to have won but did not contest Quirino's declared victory.
<br><br>

As a widower, Quirino's daughter, Vicky, took on the role of official hostess. During his presidency, Quirino implemented various social reforms, including health insurance, old-age pensions, and unemployment insurance. He also established agencies to provide economic aid and loans to marginalized Filipinos.
<br><br>

However, his term was marked by significant challenges, including the rise of the communist Hukbalahap movement, which posed a direct threat to his government. Following failed negotiations with Huk commander Luis Taruc, who openly declared his communist allegiance, the movement gained traction.
<br><br>

While Quirino's presidency saw some economic improvements and increased U.S. aid, pervasive graft and unresolved rural issues marred his administration. In 1953, during his second term, the Korean War led to the deployment of over 7,450 Filipino soldiers as part of the Philippine Expeditionary Forces to Korea (PEFTOK). Despite his efforts, Quirino was overwhelmingly defeated by Ramon Magsaysay in the 1953 election.
<br><br>

	 
</p><br><br><h1 id="sbt4"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>The Magsaysay Administration (1953–1957)</h1><p>	 
In the 1953 election, Ramon Magsaysay emerged victorious over incumbent Elpidio Quirino, aided by American officials and funds. Sworn in wearing the barong tagalog, Magsaysay became known for his close ties to the United States and his strong anti-communist stance during the Cold War. He played a pivotal role in founding the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (Manila Pact) in 1954, aimed at countering Marxist-Leninist movements across Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Oceania.

Magsaysay opened Malacañang Palace to the public, embodying his vision of a "house of the people." His integrity was exemplified when he personally covered the operating costs for a flight aboard a new Philippine Air Force plane.
<br><br>

Tragically, on March 16, 1957, Magsaysay's plane, the "Mt. Pinatubo," went missing after a trip to Cebu City. The following day, it was reported that the aircraft had crashed on Mount Manunggal, resulting in the deaths of 25 out of 26 passengers and crew. Only newspaperman Nestor Mata survived. Vice President Carlos P. Garcia, who was abroad at the time, succeeded Magsaysay and completed the remaining months of his term.
<br><br>

Magsaysay's presidency is often celebrated as a period of honest governance, dubbed the "Golden Years," and he left a lasting legacy in promoting the Philippines as a bulwark against communism. An estimated 2 million people attended his burial on March 22, 1957.
<br><br>


</p><br><br><h1 id="sbt4"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>The Garcia Administration (1957–1961)</h1><p>	 
Garcia took office after Ramón Magsaysay's tragic death in a plane crash on March 17, 1957, and he was elected to a full term later that same year during the 1957 elections.
<br><br>

During his presidency, he implemented the Bohlen–Serrano Agreement, which reduced the lease on U.S. military bases from 99 years to 25 years, with the option to renew every five years.
<br><br>

He became well-known for his Filipino First policy, which prioritized Filipino businesses over foreign investors. This policy also brought significant changes to retail trade, impacting Chinese businessmen in the country, and he initiated programs aimed at promoting thriftiness.
<br><br>

At the end of his second term, he sought re-election in the November 1961 elections but was defeated by Diosdado Macapagal, who had served as his vice president but was affiliated with the opposing Liberal Party—highlighting that in the Philippines, the president and vice president are elected separately.
<br><br>


</p><br><br><h1 id="sbt4"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>The Macapagal Administration (1961–1965)</h1><p>	 
In the 1961 presidential election, Diosdado Macapagal defeated incumbent president Carlos Garcia with a 55% to 45% margin. His administration aimed to stimulate economic development, allowing the Philippine peso to float on the free market, though his reform efforts faced opposition from the Nacionalista-dominated legislature. Notable achievements included the abolition of tenancy through the Agricultural Land Reform Code of 1963 and changing the celebration of Philippine independence from July 4 to June 12, marking Emilio Aguinaldo's declaration in 1898.
<br><br>

Macapagal's tenure was marked by significant reforms, but he lost the 1965 election to Ferdinand Marcos, a former ally who had switched to the Nacionalista Party.
<br><br>


</p><br><br><h1 id="sbt4"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>The Marcos Administration (1965–1972)</h1><p>	 
In 1965, Ferdinand Marcos was elected as the 10th president of the Philippines, prioritizing industrial growth and infrastructure projects, such as the North Luzon Expressway. However, Senator Benigno Aquino Jr. raised concerns in 1968, warning that Marcos was steering the country towards a "garrison state," citing increases in the military budget and the militarization of civilian life. During the Vietnam War, Marcos chose not to send combat troops, instead deploying the Philippine Civic Action Group (PHILCAG) in 1966, which he withdrew in November 1969 due to rising unpopularity.
<br><br>

In 1969, Marcos sought re-election and won decisively, bolstered by significant campaign spending. This led to public unrest and a balance of payments crisis, prompting his administration to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The resulting policies contributed to inflation and social upheaval.
<br><br>

By February 1971, student activists had taken over the University of the Philippines, declaring it a free commune. Protests escalated during the First Quarter Storm in 1970, blurring distinctions between leftist groups and the Communist Party. Large demonstrations against Marcos turned violent, resulting in injuries and fatalities, and further igniting weekly protests led by students.
<br><br>

Rumors of a coup d'état surfaced after the 1969 election, with a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee report revealing a plot by retired military officials to undermine and possibly assassinate Marcos. This included notable figures like Vice President Fernando Lopez and Sergio Osmeña Jr. To counter claims of U.S. support for the coup, Marcos visited the U.S. embassy, while a U.S. ambassador noted that much of the revolutionary sentiment stemmed from opposition groups.
<br><br>

In January 1970, Marcos documented his thoughts on the crisis in his diary, contemplating the arrest of the alleged coup plotters but fearing unpopularity. He ultimately leaned toward allowing the situation to escalate into violence, which could justify a declaration of martial law to suppress dissent.
<br><br>

The political climate took a turn on August 21, 1971, when a bombing at a Liberal Party rally in Plaza Miranda injured numerous attendees. In response, Marcos suspended the writ of habeas corpus, targeting suspects to eliminate political rivals and blaming the communists for the attack. Declassified CIA documents hinted at possible Marcos involvement in the bombings that year, while historian Joseph Scalice noted that, despite the Communist Party's alliance with the Liberal Party, they might have viewed the bombing as a means to provoke repression.
<br><br>

On September 22, 1972, Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile reported being ambushed, an event many suspected was staged. Although he initially acknowledged this, he later recanted.
<br><br>

The incidents at Plaza Miranda, along with the alleged ambush of Enrile and the MV Karagatan landing, were used as justifications for declaring martial law. On September 21, 1972, Marcos issued Presidential Proclamation No. 1081, claiming support from prominent figures, which was later refuted.
<br><br>

Once in power, Marcos curtailed press freedoms, dissolved Congress, and arrested opposition leaders, effectively establishing a totalitarian regime. While initial reactions to martial law were mixed, given the decline in crime rates, the military's abuses led to widespread human rights violations, with over 3,200 extrajudicial killings and tens of thousands of arrests and instances of torture.
<br><br>

As discontent grew, Marcos sought to legitimize his actions through the 1973 Constitution, which allowed for emergency powers. He promised to lift martial law by January 1981, but even after its official end, he maintained significant control and the ability to suppress dissent.
<br><br>

The martial law era was marked by severe human rights violations, with estimates of 3,257 murders, 35,000 instances of torture, and 70,000 illegal detentions. One journalist described the regime as a "grisly one-stop shop for human rights abuses," where constitutional protections were ignored, and citizens became victims of state violence.
<br><br>

From 1972 to 1980, the Philippines' GDP quadrupled from $8 billion to $32.45 billion, reflecting an average growth rate of 6% per year despite global oil crises. However, this economic growth concealed a deepening debt crisis, as external debt soared from $2.3 billion in 1970 to $26.2 billion by 1985, driven by corruption and mismanagement. By the end of Marcos’ rule, poverty incidence had increased from 41% in the 1960s to 59%, underscoring the disparity between economic indicators and the realities faced by many Filipinos.
<br><br>

During this turbulent period, around 300,000 Filipinos emigrated to the United States from 1965 to 1986, seeking better opportunities and stability away from the oppressive regime.
<br><br>

The Marcos administration was notorious for widespread corruption, with estimates of the family's stolen wealth reaching $10 billion. This plunder was facilitated through the creation of monopolies, awarding loans to political allies, and diverting public funds via various means, including the use of dummy corporations and skimming from international aid. Such practices entrenched a system of crony capitalism that benefited a select few while undermining the national economy.
<br><br>

On April 7, 1978, the first formal elections for the interim Batasang Pambansa were held. Despite significant public support, Senator Benigno Aquino Jr., who was imprisoned at the time, and his Lakas ng Bayan party failed to secure any seats. Their supporters demonstrated through a "noise barrage" in Manila the night before the elections, yet the results reflected ongoing electoral manipulation and repression of dissenting voices.
<br><br>

The presidential election on June 16, 1981, was boycotted by the opposition. Marcos faced retired General Alejo Santos of the Nacionalista Party and won decisively, securing another six-year term, while Finance Minister Cesar Virata was elected as prime minister by the Batasang Pambansa.
<br><br>

The political landscape shifted dramatically in 1983 when opposition leader Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino Jr. was assassinated at Manila International Airport upon his return from exile in the United States. This event ignited widespread dissatisfaction with Marcos and set in motion events leading to a snap presidential election on February 7, 1986. The opposition united behind Aquino’s widow, Corazon Aquino, and Salvador Laurel, head of the United Nationalists Democratic Organizations (UNIDO). However, the election was marred by reports of violence and result tampering from both sides.
<br><br>

Despite the turmoil, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) declared Marcos the winner, with a final tally of 10,807,197 votes for Marcos and 9,291,761 for Aquino. In contrast, the National Citizens' Movement for Free Elections reported that Aquino had actually won, highlighting widespread beliefs of electoral fraud.
<br><br>

International observers, including a U.S. delegation led by Senator Richard Lugar, condemned the election results. Corazon Aquino rejected the outcome and organized the "Tagumpay ng Bayan" (People's Victory) rally at Luneta Park on February 16, 1986, where she announced a civil disobedience campaign against Marcos. This rally drew around two million attendees, galvanizing her supporters.
<br><br>

In the aftermath, Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and the Reform the Armed Forces Movement (RAM) initiated a coup attempt against Marcos. When their plan was discovered, Enrile sought help from then-AFP Vice Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Fidel Ramos, who withdrew his support for the government. The two forces barricaded themselves in Camp Crame and Camp Aguinaldo, but soon found themselves trapped by Marcos’ loyalist forces.
<br><br>

A small group of Aquino supporters, led by her brother-in-law Butz Aquino, went to EDSA to show solidarity with Enrile and Ramos. They contacted Cardinal Jaime Sin, who urged the public to rally in support of the coup plotters. This call to action drew massive crowds to EDSA, leading to the largely peaceful 1986 EDSA Revolution. The movement culminated in Marcos fleeing to Hawaii, while Corazon Aquino became the 11th president of the Philippines on February 25, 1986. Under her leadership, the Philippines adopted a new constitution, marking the end of the Fourth Republic and the beginning of the Fifth Republic.
<br><br>


</p><br><br><h1 id="sbt4"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>Corazon Aquino Administration (1986–1992)</h1><p>	 
Corazon Aquino's rise to power following the People Power Revolution marked a significant restoration of democracy in the Philippines. Upon assuming the presidency in 1986, she swiftly established a revolutionary government aimed at stabilizing the nation after Ferdinand Marcos's regime. Aquino introduced a transitional "Freedom Constitution," which restored civil liberties, dismantled the entrenched Marcos bureaucracy, and abolished the Batasang Pambansa, relieving all public officials of their duties.
<br><br>

Her administration also appointed a constitutional commission that drafted a new permanent constitution, ratified in February 1987. This constitution significantly limited presidential powers, particularly regarding the declaration of martial law, proposed the creation of autonomous regions in the Cordilleras and Muslim Mindanao, and reinstated a presidential system alongside a bicameral Congress.
<br><br>

Despite these advancements, Aquino's presidency (1986-1992) was characterized by instability and several coup attempts from disaffected military factions. Economic recovery was further challenged by natural disasters, most notably the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991, which was one of the largest volcanic eruptions of the 20th century. This disaster caused significant destruction, including damage to Clark Air Base, resulting in around 700 deaths and displacing over 200,000 people.
<br><br>

In September 1991, despite Aquino's efforts, the Philippine Senate rejected a treaty that would have extended the presence of U.S. military bases, leading to the turnover of Clark Air Base in November and Subic Bay Naval Base in December 1992, effectively ending nearly a century of U.S. military presence in the Philippines.
<br><br>

Aquino’s administration faced significant challenges, including internal conflicts and natural disasters, which hindered economic and social reforms. Nonetheless, her leadership laid the groundwork for a renewed democratic framework in the Philippines.
<br><br>


</p><br><br><h1 id="sbt4"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>Fidel Ramos Administration (1992–1998)</h1><p>	 
In the 1992 elections, Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos, with the endorsement of Corazon Aquino, secured the presidency with 23.6% of the vote, beating competitors such as Miriam Defensor Santiago and Imelda Marcos. Early in his term, Ramos focused on "national reconciliation," legalizing the Communist Party and forming the National Unification Commission to foster peace talks with various insurgent groups. In June 1994, he enacted a general conditional amnesty for rebels and military personnel involved in conflicts, leading to a peace agreement with the military insurgency by October 1995.
<br><br>

Ramos also confronted challenges, including a standoff with China in 1995 over Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands. His liberal economic policies, particularly the oil-deregulation law, faced criticism for raising fuel prices, along with allegations of corruption tied to the Philippine Centennial Exposition and the PEA-AMARI land deal.
<br><br>

In 1996, he signed a peace agreement with the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), effectively ending a 24-year conflict. However, a splinter group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), continued to fight for an independent Islamic state.
<br><br>

The 1998 elections resulted in a victory for former movie actor Joseph Estrada, who garnered nearly 11 million votes, defeating House Speaker Jose De Venecia, who received 4.4 million votes, among other candidates.
<br><br>


</p><br><br><h1 id="sbt4"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>Joseph Estrada Administration (1998–2001)</h1><p>	 
Joseph Estrada took office during the Asian Financial Crisis but managed to steer the economy toward recovery, achieving a growth rate of 3.4% by 1999 after a low of −0.6% in 1998. He attempted to amend the 1987 Constitution through the CONCORD initiative, aimed at liberalizing economic provisions to attract foreign investments, but was unsuccessful.
<br><br>

On March 21, 2000, Estrada declared an "all-out-war" against the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) amid escalating secessionist tensions in Mindanao, leading to the capture of 46 MILF camps, including their headquarters.
<br><br>

In October 2000, Estrada was implicated in a corruption scandal involving illegal gambling, which prompted the House of Representatives to impeach him on November 13 for bribery, graft, and constitutional violations. His impeachment trial began on December 7 but stalled on January 17, 2001, when senators allied with him blocked the opening of crucial evidence.

This led to widespread protests, known as "EDSA II," demanding his resignation. With the support of the military and police withdrawn, Estrada's cabinet resigned en masse. On January 20, the Supreme Court declared the presidency vacant, swearing in Vice President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo as the 14th President. Estrada claimed he did not resign but took a leave of absence, though the Supreme Court upheld Arroyo's legitimacy on March 2, 2001.

Vice President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo was sworn in as president following Estrada's departure, despite his allies challenging the legitimacy of her government. The Supreme Court upheld her presidency twice. After Estrada's arrest on plunder charges in April 2001, thousands rallied in "EDSA III" to demand his reinstatement, attempting to storm Malacañang Palace on May 1, but were stopped by authorities. Arroyo's position was further solidified by her coalition's overwhelming victory in the May 2001 elections.
<br><br>

Her early presidency faced challenges, including coalition conflicts and a military mutiny in July 2003, leading to a month-long nationwide state of rebellion. Initially announcing she wouldn’t run in the May 2004 elections, Arroyo reversed her decision and was re-elected for a six-year term starting June 30, 2004.
<br><br>

In 2005, a wiretapped conversation emerged, seemingly revealing Arroyo discussing election results with an official, sparking protests demanding her resignation. While she admitted to the conversation, she denied any electoral fraud. Efforts to impeach her failed that year. Towards the end of her term, Arroyo proposed a controversial constitutional overhaul to shift from a unitary presidential republic to a federal parliamentary government.

</p><br><br><h1 id="sbt4"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>Benigno Aquino III Administration (2010–2016)</h1><p>	 
On June 9, 2010, the Congress of the Philippines proclaimed Benigno Aquino III as President-elect, having secured 15,208,678 votes. Jejomar Binay was declared Vice President-elect with 14,645,574 votes, defeating Mar Roxas.
<br><br>

Following his victory, Aquino initiated the presidential transition process, which involved organizing his cabinet and coordinating with the outgoing administration. Outgoing President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo established a Presidential Transition Cooperation Team to ensure an orderly transition.
<br><br>

Aquino appointed key members to his transition team, including Mar Roxas and Paquito Ochoa, Jr. He chose Bahay Pangarap in Malacañang Park as his official residence, opting not to live in the traditional Malacañang Palace due to its size.
<br><br>

Aquino named Paquito Ochoa, Jr. as Executive Secretary and Corazon Soliman as Secretary of Social Welfare and Development. He also appointed Leila de Lima as Secretary of Justice and established a truth commission to investigate corruption under Arroyo, headed by former Chief Justice Hilario Davide, Jr.
<br><br>

Aquino and Binay were inaugurated on June 30, 2010, at Quirino Grandstand in Luneta Park. Associate Justice Conchita Carpio-Morales administered the oath, as Aquino declined to have Chief Justice Renato Corona, appointed by Arroyo, officiate.
<br><br>

In 2013, the Aquino administration began formulating a new framework for peace talks with the New People's Army. However, a deadly clash in Mamasapano, Maguindanao, in 2015, which resulted in the deaths of 44 police commandos, stalled progress on the Bangsamoro Basic Law.

</p><br><br><h1 id="sbt4"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>Rodrigo Duterte Administration (2016–2022)</h1><p>	 
Rodrigo Duterte won the 2016 presidential election with 39.01% of the votes, becoming the first president from Mindanao. Leni Robredo was elected vice president. Duterte's presidency began on June 30, 2016, with his inauguration at Malacañang Palace.
<br><br>

A major aspect of his administration was the controversial drug war, which resulted in a death toll exceeding 5,000 by early 2019. The campaign faced significant criticism for alleged human rights violations, leading to international scrutiny and protests.
<br><br>

Duterte also shifted foreign relations toward China and Russia while criticizing the United States. In November 2016, the Supreme Court approved the burial of Ferdinand Marcos at the Libingan ng mga Bayani, which sparked protests.
<br><br>

In 2017, Duterte launched the "Build, Build, Build" program to enhance infrastructure with a budget of $160 to $180 billion through 2022. He enacted the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act, providing free tuition in public universities, and signed laws for health care, urban development, and economic reforms to attract foreign investment.
<br><br>

Duterte initiated measures to combat corruption, improve agricultural policies, and implement various health and safety laws. His administration faced challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a GDP contraction of 9.5% in 2020, followed by a recovery to 5.6% in 2021. Throughout his presidency, Duterte maintained a relatively high domestic approval rating.
<br><br>

</p><br><br><h1 id="sbt4"><span class="bookmark-icon"></span>Bongbong Marcos Administration (2022–present)</h1><p>	 
Ferdinand Marcos Jr., popularly known as Bongbong, assumed the presidency in 2022, aiming to distinguish his administration from the controversial policies of his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte. His election followed a period marked by geopolitical tensions, particularly regarding the South China Sea, where China's ambitions created friction.
<br><br>

Marcos Jr. won the presidential election by a landslide, with Sara Duterte, daughter of Rodrigo Duterte, as his vice presidential running mate. Both were sworn in on June 30, 2022. However, his campaign faced criticism for its lack of transparency, as he avoided public debates and relied heavily on social media, often sidestepping tough questions about his policies and his father's dictatorship.
<br><br>

Critics have expressed concern over his leadership, pointing to a lack of clear vision in addressing pressing issues like inflation and food security. Additionally, fears of political dynasties and historical revisionism have resurfaced, with many worried that the human rights abuses during his father's regime are being downplayed or overlooked.
